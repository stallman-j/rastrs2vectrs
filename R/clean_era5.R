#' Clean ERA5 Rasters
#' @description takes as data a raster file (ideally taken from Copernicus ERA5),
#' selects a particular variable to analyze and subsets the rasters according to
#' this variable, and rotates the rasters so they can be extracted to more typical polygon data
#' @author jillianstallman
#' @param input_path file path to your raw ERA data (e.g. file.path("E:","Projects","data","01_raw",ERA_5"))
#' @param input_filename the short name that you use to distinguish the .nc file
#' @param input_filetype the type of input file; needs to be something terra::rast() can read
#' @param keep_substrings a character vector of the substrings which define which layers you would like to keep
#' @param output_path the file path to put your cleaned data. Creates it if it doesn't already exist, e.g. file.path("E:","Projects","data","03_clean","ERA_5")
#' @param output_filename the name to give the cleaned ERA5 raster. NULL defaults to:
#'  paste0(input_filename,".tif"); note this uses terra::writeRaster, not saveRDS
#'  @return just puts the correctly rotated and subsetted raster into the output_path folder
#' @export

# ERA5 data is referenced in the horizontal with respect to the WGS84 ellipse (which defines the major/minor axes)
# and in the vertical it is referenced to the EGM96 geoid over land but over ocean it is referenced to
# mean sea level, with the approximation that this is assumed to be coincident with the geoid
